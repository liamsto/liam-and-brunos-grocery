# Executive Summary
To improve the user experience of the online store, we have implemented the following features described in the FEATURES markdown file. The online store now has the ability to store a user's cart between sessions, create account data validation, display product reviews on the product page, and display item inventory by store/warehouse.

Additionally, in previous labs, we added a greatly improved UI using CSS, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly. We also implemented a database to store user information and product data, which allows for better data management and retrieval.
